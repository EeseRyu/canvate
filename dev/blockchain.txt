For smart contracts and dApps, there’s nothing compared to Solidity and Javascript. 

-----------------------------

I write smart contracts, Create simple dApps, and even set up private blockchains and working environments for companies. It’s not really that hard a thing to do, but people are looking for someone who knows how to do it. And that’s where I come in.

-----------------------------

Distributed systems, crypto currency, distributed apps, distributed ledger technology are all subsections of a new world of technical challenges that developers need to navigate.


-----------------------------

Could you give an example of your path to the private blockchain?
The first thing I’ve done with the blockchain was to create my own Bitcoin client implementation. It was very limited and inefficient, but it worked. And I need to do it in order to understand how Bitcoin works. Later on, I added the block architecture and a library for validating (simple) transactions. Once I had all of these components, I essentially had all that is required to have my own private blockchain. But of course, there’s no need to build tools like that today. Instead you can just create your own blockchain by using almost any existing full node – either for Bitcoin or for Ethereum.

 
 -----------------------------
 
 Geth and Parity are clients that can work with the main-net, the test-nets, and they can even help you create your own private chain. Ganache is a great Javascript client for testing purposes. It comes preinstalled with Truffle, which is by far the most used program today for creating and testing smart contracts. Truffle itself is a Javascript (node.js) framework that is coupled with another client (usually Ganache) to test smart contracts using Javascript scripts. You can automate the entire testing process and have it done in seconds. For example, you can create a script that deploys a token’s smart contract, and then try to send tokens from one account to another. The entire process will run locally on your machine in less than a second.

Working with such tools requires a very basic knowledge of Javascript, IT (specific to your OS), command line tools, etc. An intermediate developer should have his or her working environment under control in just few hours, tops.

-----------------------------

Course Recommendations
What are the top four courses (in your opinion) that you recommend for starting a career in blockchain development?
b9labs
Blockgeeks
Udemy has several great courses
There is also this YouTube channel
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbXiy1W_1HSMawmBDfo_TOA/videos

Bitcoin Magazine
Blockgeeks
Ethereum and Bitcoin Stack Exchange
Reddit

------------------------------

For smart contracts: Remix Online IDE and Metamask – you’ll have your smart contracts completed within five minutes. Once you’re ready to go to the next level, learn how to work with Truffle, and how to set up your private chain using Geth or Parity.

For cryptocurrency and understanding how the blockchain works, I suggest using Python.

--------------------------------

It’s much easier than you think. There’s no magic going on under the hood. The blockchain is simply a specific data structure, and around this data structure is a new ecosystem to learn. Separate your learning process into two categories. One for learning how Bitcoin works, and by doing so, how the blockchain itself works. And the other is for learning how to interact with Ethereum and how to use it for smart contracts. At the end of the day, you’ll need to combine both of these concepts into one solid skillset.

---------------------------------

Solidity is Ethereum’s special language for smart contracts, and Truffle is a popular Ethereum framework. You should be familiar with both to be successful in blockchain development. Solidity is pretty easy to understand, as it is relatively similar to JavaScript. To get more comfortable with Truffle, you can try this step-by-step guide to learn how to build your first blockchain app with Truffle.

---------------------------------

Follow this nice tutorial from Loom to build a game using Solidity. You will make an army of zombies and then fight a war on the blockchain. All of this will be done with Solidity, so by the end of the tutorial you will become pretty experienced with this language. Isn’t that cool? Also, this tutorial will allow you to see that blockchain and smart contracts are useful not only for payments, but for game development as well. Maybe that will help you think outside the box and come up with your own ideas about blockchain game development.

----------------------------------

The code for smart contracts written in Solidity is only a tiny part of the overall codebase for a DApp. The codebase can be written in any other language like Python, Java, or C++. Solidity can be intuitively understood by any developer from first glance as it’s pretty straightforward. So you don’t need to spend too much time learning it to become a successful DApp developer. Your coding skills in other languages are far more important for that job.

----------------------------------

As a blockchain developer, you will need to be comfortable with different data structures like Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, and HashMaps.

----------------------------------

19. Build a DApp and monetize it
monetize dappGeorgios Konstantopoulos, Researcher and Writer at Loom Network

DApps are expected to see tremendous growth in the coming years, similar to the mobile apps with the spread of smartphones. You can start building DApps and monetize from them right now, as the CryptoKitties example has demonstrated. You can track the value of transactions in DApps at DappRadar. Keep in mind that developers typically get around 2-5% of each transaction, and if your DApp is as successful like CryptoKitties, your profits will be huge.

You can choose one of the following ways to effectively monetize your DApp:

Make a crowdsale and launch a token
Take a percentage of transaction fees
Charge an amount for premium functionality
Introduce a paid subscription or membership option
Sell advertisements
Take donations

How To Start Learning Blockchain Development

Posted by @eXeBlock on November 21, 2017
Since blockchain is such a recent development in the tech world, it can be hard to know how to go about getting started in the industry.
While many developers are aware of the potential that blockchain technology has to disrupt the world around us, few are sure if the career path is right for them.

Getting started with blockchain technology is the same as learning about any other field in the tech world – it requires meticulous research and self-education.

Luckily, we’ve broken down some of the basic steps on how to get started developing with blockchain technology:

Identifying blockchain types
There are several options when it comes to public blockchains, but the most popular choices by developers are the Bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.

In terms of private blockchains, there are additional options such as: Hyperledger Fabric.

Identifying the differences between private and public blockchains, and the various blockchain platforms, will make it easier for you to get started as a developer, as you can narrow your searches to platform-specific resources.

Programming languages
If you already have previous programming experience, one way to get started with blockchain is by selecting a programming language that resembles one that you’re already familiar with.

For example, Nicolas Dorier has published a guide on blockchain programming with C# – which is an invaluable resource for any developers with prior experience in C-based programming.

A popular choice for developers who are interested in working on smart contracts is Solidity. Solidity is a programming language designed specifically for developing smart contracts via the Ethereum blockchain.

There are many free and paid resources available online for learning Solidity regardless of your level of experience.

Online resources
While it may seem like learning to develop blockchain is an uphill battle, we are lucky to live in an age where helpful information is abundant online – you just need to know where to look.

For absolute beginners, it might be worth taking a look at Lauren Stephanian’s post on Medium, “From ‘What is Blockchain?’ to building a blockchain in less than an hour.”

Stephanian’s guide is a helpful resource for breaking down some complex concepts in a way that’s easy to follow along with.

Similarly, Daniel van Flymen’s guide, “Learn Blockchain by Building One,” is a great beginners resource for anyone who feels like they ‘learn by doing.’

For developing decentralized applications, (dApps), some good beginners resources are Develop DApps on Ethereum (Tutorial Series for Beginners) and Dapps for Beginners.

Further reading
Once you’re past the basic stages of blockchain development, and have a sense of direction for what you’d like to learn, it’s time to begin the process of mastering this exciting new technology.

If you’ve studied programming in the past, you should already be aware that educational resources can be pricey at times. If you’re willing to pay to further your education, there are a lot of online courses about blockchain that you could choose from.

It is, however, possible to learn without having to invest any money. Due to the nature of blockchain, you should find the community to be quite open and helpful.

There are a lot of beginner-to-advanced guides online that can be found by narrowing your search terms. Simply look for educational resources about aspects of blockchain that interest you, and are designed for the platform you’ve chosen to master.
